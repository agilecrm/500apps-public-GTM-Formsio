### Installation

If your website integrates Google Tag Manager, adding forms to your site doesn't require any coding. All you'll have to do is add a new tag based on the Forms.io community template published by Google.

1. Log in to Google Tag Manager, navigate your account and click on "Add a new tag".

2. Search for our community template "Forms.io by 500apps" in the "Community Template Gallery".

3. Add the template to your tag by clicking on "Add to Workspace".

4. First copy the dev-id (<div id='DIV-ID'></div>) and place it in the ”Forms.io Key”

5. Then copy the key from the application and place it next to the dev-id in the "Forms.io Key" field in your tag after the template is added.

6. In the triggers tab add Form submission

7. Add a trigger by clicking on "Triggering" below the Tag and choose "Form Submission".

8. Click on the Submit button in the upper right corner of the page.

9. Upload the Forms.io SDK file in the root directory of your website to customize your opt-ins. The default service worker will be used by the website if the SDK file is not uploaded.

10. Insert the Google Tag Manager script into your website and head over to your website to fill the form.
